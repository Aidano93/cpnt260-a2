## Context:

(same as previous assignment)

The 'client' for this site is a band from Montreal, QC called Sunforger. They are good friends of mine and are currently lacking a website. Many of the design choices were made in an attempt to match their general visual aesthetic.

The goal of this site is to provide some important information to potential fans in the form of 'Bio' and 'Tour Dates', as well as being a central hub with access to their social media and streaming sites. The 'Review' section was added to give new fans a descriptive flavour of their sound, and also showcase some of their press.

## Notes:

### Refactors from A1:
- **Vertcal nav successfully implemented via media query**
- Added a clamp() for responsive font size throughout
- Removed cta-button, added additional items to nav and linked them to each section of the page
- **Card section added. Labeled as 'Members'**

### Card Section:
- Certain creative liberties were taken with this section in an attempt to emulate this [image](https://www.facebook.com/sunforgerband/photos/a.1654248918137430/2707730806122564/). Sunforger use it as a press photo and I thought it would be a good challenge to try to recreate it in card form. I understand that it doesn't translate as well on mobile, but I think it works for now. I may add a media query and rearrange the 'crests' in the future.
